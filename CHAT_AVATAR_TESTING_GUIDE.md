# 🧪 Chat Avatar Testing Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### 1. Access Your Dashboard
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Login to Hospital Dashboard
- Use your hospital credentials
- Navigate to the dashboard

### 3. Open Chat/Messages Page
- Click on "Messages" in the sidebar
- You should see the conversations list

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ In Conversation List:
- **Patient avatars** beside each conversation
- **Patient initials** if no image available (e.g., "JD" for John Doe)
- **Professional styling** with rounded images

### ✅ In Chat Window:
- **Hospital messages**: 
  - Blue bubbles on the RIGHT
  - Hospital avatar on the RIGHT side
- **Patient messages**:
  - Grey bubbles on the LEFT  
  - Patient avatar on the LEFT side

### ✅ Fallback Behavior:
- If hospital has no image → Hospital icon (🏥)
- If patient has no image → Patient initials in colored circle

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Send a New Message
1. Open any conversation
2. Type a message and send
3. **Expected**: Your message appears with hospital avatar on the right

### Scenario 2: View Patient Messages  
1. Look at existing patient messages
2. **Expected**: Patient avatar appears on the left of their messages

### Scenario 3: Test Different Conversations
1. Open multiple conversations
2. **Expected**: Each shows correct patient avatar in conversation list

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If avatars don't show:
1. **Check browser console** (F12 → Console)
2. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Clear browser cache**

### If still not working:
1. **Server logs**: Check the terminal where server is running
2. **Check Firebase**: Ensure images exist in Firebase Storage
3. **API test**: Try accessing APIs directly (will need authentication)
